Team Members:

Individual Contributions for assignment 1:

1) Vineeth Reddy: Worked on the forking and setuid() side of things whether parent should fork into child process and continue the flow
2) Gunjal Gupta: Worked on dropping priviledges for nobody user and handling error scenarios and edge cases. Made sure client server communication through sockets is working as expected.

Pushed the final code(for assignment 1) by combining locally in the system and checking for errors
